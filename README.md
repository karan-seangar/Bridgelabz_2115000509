# Study Log

## 28-01-2025
- **Topic Covered:** Method Questions
  - Focused on understanding the different types of methods in Java, including instance methods, static methods, and their use cases.
  - Explored method signatures, return types, and parameters.
  - Worked on exercises involving method overloading and method overriding to get hands-on experience.
  - **Key Takeaways:**
    - Understanding the concept of method scope.
    - The importance of parameters and return types in methods.

## 29-01-2025
- **Topic Covered:** String and Built-in Functions Questions
  - Practiced various string manipulation techniques, such as substring, indexOf, and concatenation.
  - Delved into the use of built-in functions for common tasks like parsing strings to integers, trimming whitespace, and checking string equality.
  - Explored StringBuilder and StringBuffer for efficient string handling.
  - **Key Takeaways:**
    - The difference between mutable and immutable objects (String vs StringBuilder).
    - Using built-in functions to simplify coding tasks.

## 30-01-2025
- **Topic Covered:** Java Classes and Object Questions
  - Focused on understanding Java classes, objects, and how to define them in Java.
  - Explored constructors, instance variables, and methods within classes.
  - Worked on understanding how objects are created and how memory is managed.
  - **Key Takeaways:**
    - The concept of encapsulation and how itâ€™s achieved using classes and objects.
    - The importance of constructors in initializing objects.
    - Differences between instance variables and local variables.

## 02-02-2025
- **Topic Covered:** Java Constructors, Instance vs. Class Variables, Access Modifiers
  - Focused on different types of constructors, including default and parameterized constructors, and their role in object initialization.
  - Explored the difference between instance variables (which belong to an object) and class variables (which belong to the class).
  - Worked on access modifiers (public, private, protected) and their role in encapsulation and controlling access to class members.
  - **Key Takeaways:**
    - Constructors are essential for object initialization, and understanding constructor chaining is crucial.
    - Access modifiers help secure your code by limiting access to variables and methods.
    - Instance variables are tied to individual objects, whereas class variables are shared among all objects of the class.

# Topics Covered

## `this` Keyword
- Refers to the current object instance.
- Used to differentiate instance variables from parameters.
- Can be used to invoke current class constructors.
- Helps pass the current object as a parameter to methods.
- Useful for returning the current class instance.

## `static` Keyword
- Used for memory management and shared properties.
- Can be applied to variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes.
- Static members belong to the class rather than instances.
- Static methods can be called without creating an object.
- Static blocks are executed once when the class is loaded.

## `final` Keyword
- Used to declare constants, prevent method overriding, and restrict inheritance.
- A final variable cannot be reassigned after initialization.
- A final method cannot be overridden by subclasses.
- A final class cannot be extended.

## `instanceof` Operator
- Used to test whether an object is an instance of a specific class or subclass.
- Returns `true` if the object belongs to the given type, otherwise `false`.
- Helps prevent `ClassCastException` by ensuring safe type casting.
